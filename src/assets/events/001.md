UNS-CV *Rio Grande* and UAD *Morse* have entered low Cressidium orbit, virtually shaken hands with the local authorities, and opened diplomatic channels. As this is the third diplomatic mission to the planet, the procedures should be well practiced by now, except that the Vestan Sovereignty had invented some new forms they required Ambassador Bannerjee's retinue to complete before the Vestan contingent would join the summit. Scuttlebutt says the LSA contingent objected given that the summit is to happen in Nov Elysia and not on Vestan soil, and immediately the two groups started arguing. Sounds like a great start, but in any case Bannerjee and his retinue boarded one of the *Rio Grande*'s shuttles and made a landing flight later this same day to Nov Elysia.
