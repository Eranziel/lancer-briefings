Six weeks, and the summit is still ongoing. Ambassador Bannerjee has made a few trips back upwell to his ship and to the *Rio Grande* for recesses, but seems as unphased as ever. You saw an officer ask them once how the talks were going, and their only response was a slight smile and a, "Just fine". The next day he flew back downwell and the talks renewed.

Up here on the *Rio Grande*, it's been more drills, more maintenance. Some of the crew have been enjoying local media during their down time, a change from their usual omninet offerings. A few groups of engineers and scientists have come and gone on diplomatic exchanges, probably so they can get a taste of what Union can offer technologically. No such military tours either direction, so us mech pilots have been stuck up here the whole time.

Three days ago, Ambassador Bannerjee requested Captain Farris join them down on the planet to give a speech or two and meet with some of the delegates. Probably hoping that a new face and fresh perspective will help shift some attitudes, break the stalemate. Lt. Kim has had command in her absence, so of course drills have increased.
