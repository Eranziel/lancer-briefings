21 days before reaching low Cressidium orbit, UNS-CV *Rio Grande* cycled its full crew into active duty. For the previous three months (31 months realtime), the light carrier has been operating with rotating crews at 1/3 full duty, with the remainder entering stasis to conserve resources and energy during the journey. Now, the sleepers join the last shift of active crew in "uptime". During this final approach, the crew is put through its paces in drills, ship maintenance, and training - while the *Rio Grande*'s presence is mostly a formality, Captain Farris has every intention of both making a good impression and being ready should the need arise. Lt. Kim has taken to this ramp up with particular gusto, much to the (private) annoyance of most of the enlisted crew.
