A broad classification, the T-3 range includes conventional-kinetic anti-materiel rifles, super-rapid cycling pulse rifles, missile racks, cannons, and drone nexuses – “hive”style launchers that serve as miniature factory, hangar, and deployment systems for portable drones. The classification also includes the fearsome “segment knife”, a system that uses flash-printing to produce disposable edged weapons in a vicinity around the user.",
