  "text_appearance": "<p>Kieran Vasquez cuts a sharp, battle-hardened figure that reflects both their engineering roots and frontline combat experience. Standing just under average height, they carry themselves with a quiet confidence, wrapped in a weathered, dark pilot’s jumpsuit reinforced with tactical harnesses and tool straps. Their outfit is marked by signs of wear—burnt seams, oil stains, and faded insignias—yet meticulously maintained where it counts, a testament to their engineer’s precision.</p><p>A cascade of <strong>white hair</strong>, accented with a striking <strong>teal streak</strong>, spills from beneath a pair of worn <strong>polarized goggles</strong> perched on their brow. The right side of their face bears sleek <strong>cybernetic implants</strong>, etched along the jaw and temple—interfaces for their nanotech augmentations. Tiny <strong>glowing nano-bots</strong> often skitter along their suit or skin, an unsettling yet fascinating reminder of the tech symbiosis they command.</p><p>Their <strong>left arm</strong>, entirely cybernetic, is a brutal mix of industrial design and advanced function—crafted not for aesthetics, but for durability and adaptability in both engineering work and combat. In their gloved right hand, they carry a rugged <strong>holo-slate</strong>, its interface flickering with schematics, code snippets, and targeting overlays.</p><p>Kieran’s expression is one of sharp focus—cold, calculating, yet not devoid of empathy. It’s the look of someone who has seen both the workshop and the battlefield, and knows exactly where they stand in either.</p>",
  "notes": "“Everything breaks… it’s how you fix it that counts.”\n\nKieran Vasquez was never meant to be a soldier.\nBorn in the Martian orbital colonies, they were the child of generational engineers — workers who built the ships and reactors that powered humanity’s expansion. Gifted with a mind wired for mechanics and microstructures, Kieran rose quickly through the Nanotechnics Division of the Ikaros Research Conglomerate, working on experimental nano-reactive systems designed for industrial self-repair and advanced material integration.\n\nTheir career, however, imploded — quite literally — when a classified nanite experiment went rogue, devouring a research station’s core and forcing Kieran into a desperate fight for survival. Stranded for three weeks with failing life support, they reverse-engineered a broken-down mech frame into a makeshift escape pod.\nThat experience broke Kieran’s trust in corporate labs and ivory-tower scientists. They left the labs behind, choosing instead the unpredictable freedom of mercenary life on the fringe colonies.\n\nKnown now as “Nano”, Kieran pilots their custom Everest frame, Polypheme, a brutal blend of frontier engineering and bleeding-edge tech. For them, battle is just another system to solve — another machine to take apart, bit by bit.\n\nThey live by one rule: never trust a system you didn’t build yourself.",
  "history": "<p>Kieran Vasquez was a <strong>nano-scale systems engineer</strong> turned mech pilot after a catastrophic accident at the research facility left them stranded in deep orbit with nothing but their personal tools and a derelict frame. They retrofitted a broken-down chassis using their nanotech expertise—creating a custom integration of advanced micro-scale reactors and weapon systems.</p>",
